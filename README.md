RNA-Sequencing Pipeline for Inflammatory Liver Modeling

This repository contains the code and certain files to reproduce the analysis found in: Wang et al. "Engineering Modular 3D Liver Culture Microenvironments In Vitro to Parse the Interplay between Biophysical and Biochemical Microenvironment Cues on Hepatic Phenotypes"  
We hope that the RNA-Sequencing analysis pipeline code may be generalized and updated for future RNA-Seq projects.  
The main code and guide is in the jupyter notebook (RNAseq_Pipeline_Wangetal.ipynb), while associated files should allow the user to skip certain steps, such as alignment and generation of a ensemblID-regular gene name dictionary.
