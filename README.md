RNA-Sequencing Pipeline for Inflammatory Liver Modeling

This repository contains the code and certain files to reproduce the analysis found in: Wang et al.  
We hope that the RNA-Sequencing analysis pipeline code may be generalized and updated for future RNA-Seq projects.  
The main code and guide is in the jupyter notebook, while associated files should allow the user to skip certain steps, such as alignment and generation of a ensemblID-regular gene name dictionary.
