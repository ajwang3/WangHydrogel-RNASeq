RNA-Sequencing Pipeline for Inflammatory Liver Modeling

This repository contains the code and certain files to reproduce the analysis found in: Wang et al. "Engineering Modular 3D Liver Culture Microenvironments In Vitro to Parse the Interplay between Biophysical and Biochemical Microenvironment Cues on Hepatic Phenotypes"  (https://doi.org/10.1002/anbr.202100049) Sequences and counts are stored under: GSE166256.

The main code and guide is in the jupyter notebook (RNAseq_Pipeline_Wangetal.ipynb), while associated files should allow the user to skip certain steps, such as alignment and generation of an ensemblID-regular gene name dictionary. 

V1.0 - Initial upload
V1.1 (11.28.21) - Cleanup for publication
